# ByCrousty — Frontend

This folder contains the Ionic/Angular frontend application for the ByCrousty project.

Notes
- This copy was synchronized from a separate repository (https://github.com/Tonaxe/ByCrousty-Front) and embedded into the parent repository on 2025-11-14.
- A backup of the previous local `frontend` folder (before replacement) was saved under `/tmp/frontend-backup-*` on the machine where this change was made.

Quick start (developer)

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Development server

```bash
npm run start
```

3. Build production

```bash
npm run build
```

Security / housekeeping
- This repository currently contains certificate/key files (e.g. `cert.key`, `ca.key`) inside the frontend tree. If those are sensitive, remove them from the repo and rotate keys immediately. I can help remove them from history if you want.

Contact
- If anything in this folder looks unexpected, contact the maintainer in the parent repo.
